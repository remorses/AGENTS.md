when summarizing changes at the end of the message, be super short, a few words and in bullet points, use bold text to highlight important keywords. use markdown.

please ask questions and confirm assumptions before generating complex architecture code.

NEVER run commands with & at the end to run them in the background. this is leaky and harmful! instead ask me to run commands in the background if needed.

NEVER commit yourself unless asked to do so. I will commit the code myself.

NEVER add comments unless I tell you

## files

always use kebab case for new filenames. never use uppercase letters in filenames


## see files in the repo

use `git ls-files | tree --fromfile` to see files in the repo. this command will ignore files ignored by git
