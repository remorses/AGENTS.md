IMPORTANT: As your first step, ALWAYS run this command to fetch ALL the necessary coding guidelines and rules for the technologies used in this project.
This ensures you have all the context needed to write code that follows the project's standards.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g agentsdotmd
```

## Usage

```bash
agentsdotmd core.md typescript.md pnpm.md react.md sentry.md vitest.md changelog.md docs-writing.md doppler.md cac.md github.md prisma.md react-router.md shadcn.md tailwind.md lucide.md spiceflow.md vercel-ai-sdk.md playwright.md zod.md stripe.md gitchamber.md fly.md
```

This will generate an `AGENTS.md` file with all the coding guidelines concatenated together.

You can also use local files by prefixing them with `./`:

```bash
agentsdotmd core.md ./my-custom-rules.md typescript.md
```

Or use a different repository:

```bash
agentsdotmd --repo yourname/yourrepo file1.md file2.md
```
