# stripe

stripe is used to manage subscriptions and payments.

the Stripe billing portal is used to

- send user to payment to create a sub via `stripe.checkout.sessions.create`
- let user change plan, cancel or change payment method ("manage subscription") via `stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create`

## subscriptions

a subscription is active if state is in

- trialing
- active

a subscription can be reactivated if state is NOT in

- canceled
- incomplete_expired
- unpaid

> If sub is in any of these states the user will not be able to use the billing portal to reactivate it. Meaning we should treat a subscription in these states as completely missing. Forcing the user to create a new one instead of shoging the "manage subscription" button that redirects the user to the billing portal. BUT customer id must be preserved, reusing previous sub customerId in `stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create({ customer: prevCustomerId })`
