## reading github repositories

you can use gitchamber.com to read repo files. run `curl https://gitchamber.com` to see how the API works. always use curl to fetch the responses of gitchamber.com

for example when working with the vercel ai sdk, you can fetch the latest docs using:

https://gitchamber.com/repos/repos/vercel/ai/main/files

use gitchamber to read the .md files using curl
