# github

you can use the `gh` cli to do operations on github for the current repository. For example: open issues, open PRs, check actions status, read workflow logs, etc.

## get current github repo

`git config --get remote.origin.url`

## checking status of latest github actions workflow run

```bash
gh run list # lists latest actions runs
gh run watch <id> --exit-status # if workflow is in progress, wait for the run to complete. the actions run is finished when this command exits. Set a tiemout of at least 10 minutes when running this command
gh run view <id> --log-failed # read the logs for failed steps in the actions run
gh run view <id> --log # read all logs for a github actions run
```

## reading github repositories

you can use gitchamber.com to read repo files. run `curl https://gitchamber.com` to see how the API works. always use curl to fetch the responses of gitchamber.com

for example when working with the vercel ai sdk, you can fetch the latest docs using:

https://gitchamber.com/repos/repos/vercel/ai/main/files

use gitchamber to read the .md files using curl
