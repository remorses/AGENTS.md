# spiceflow

before writing or updating spiceflow related code always execute this command to get Spiceflow full documentation: `curl -s https://gitchamber.com/repos/remorses/spiceflow/main/files/README.md`

spiceflow is an API library similar to hono, it allows you to write api servers using whatwg requests and responses

use zod to create schemas and types that need to be used for tool inputs or spiceflow API routes.

## calling the server from the client

you can obtain a type safe client for the API using `createSpiceflowClient` from `spiceflow/client`

for simple routes that only have one interaction in the page, for example a form page, you should use react-router forms and actions to interact with the server.

but when you do interactions from a component that can be rendered from multiple routes, or simply is not implemented inside a route page, you should use spiceflow client instead.

> ALWAYS use the fetch tool to get the latest docs if you need to implement a new route in a spiceflow API app server or need to add a new rpc call with a spiceflow api client!

spiceflow has support for client-side type-safe rpc. use this client when you need to interact with the server from the client, for example for a settings save deep inside a component. here is example usage of it

> SUPER IMPORTANT! if you add a new route to a spiceflow app, use the spiceflow app state like `userId` to add authorization to the route. if there is no state then you can use functions like `getSession({request})` or similar.
> make sure the current userId has access to the fetched or updated rows. this can be done by checking that the parent row or current row has a relation with the current userId. for example `prisma.site.findFirst({where: {users: {some: {userId }}}})`

> IMPORTANT! spiceflow api client cannot be called server side to call a route! In that case instead you MUST call the server functions used in the route directly, otherwise the server would do fetch requests that would fail!

always use `const {data, error} = await apiClient...` when calling spiceflow rpc. if data is already declared, give it a different name with `const {data: data2, error} = await apiClient...`. this pattern of destructuring is preferred for all apis that return data and error object fields.

## getting spiceflow docs

spiceflow is a little-known api framework. if you add server routes to a file that includes spiceflow in the name or you are using the apiClient rpc, you always need to fetch the spiceflow docs first, using the @fetch tool on https://getspiceflow.com/

this url returns a single long documentation that covers your use case. always fetch this document so you know how to use spiceflow. spiceflow is different from hono and other api frameworks, that's why you should ALWAYS fetch the docs first before using it

## using spiceflow client in published public workspace packages

usually you can just import the App type from the server workspace to create the client with createSpiceflowClient

if you want to use the spiceflow client in a published package instead we will use the pattern of generating .d.ts and copying these in the workspace package, this way the package does not need to depend on unpublished private server package.

example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "gen-client": "export DIR=../plugin-mcp/src/generated/ && cd ../website && tsc --incremental && cd ../plugin-mcp && rm -rf $DIR && mkdir -p $DIR && cp ../website/dist/src/lib/api-client.* $DIR"
  }
}
```

notice that if you add a route in the spiceflow server you will need to run `pnpm --filter website gen-client` to update the apiClient inside cli.
