## writing docs

when generating a .md or .mdx file to document things, always add a frontmatter with title and description. also add a prompt field with the exact prompt used to generate the doc. use @ to reference files and urls and provide any context necessary to be able to recreate this file from scratch using a model. if you used urls also reference them. reference all files you had to read to create the doc. use yaml | syntax to add this prompt and never go over the column width of 80
