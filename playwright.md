# playwright

you can control the browser using the playwright mcp tools. these tools let you control the browser to get information or accomplish actions

if i ask you to test something in the browser, know that the website dev server is already running at http://localhost:7664 for website and :7777 for docs-website (but docs-website needs to use the website domain specifically, for example name-hash.localhost:7777)
