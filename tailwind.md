## tailwind v4

this project uses tailwind v4. this new tailwind version does not use tailwind.config.js. instead it does all configuration in css files.

read https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide to understand the updates landed in tailwind v4 if you do not have tailwind v4 in your training context. Ignore the parts that talk about running the upgrade cli. this project already uses tailwind v4 so no need to upgrade anything.
